A classic on management teams - it's a guide for leaders on how to overcome common challenges that can hinder team performance. The book identifies five dysfunctions that can undermine a team's effectiveness: absence of trust, fear of conflict, lack of commitment, avoidance of accountability, and inattention to results. Lencioni provides practical strategies for addressing these dysfunctions and building a high-performing team - all in the form of a light-reading story.
