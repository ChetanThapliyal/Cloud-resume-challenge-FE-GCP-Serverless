 I started using OKR's because they were in place - as many of us. Reading the book from John Doerr, it's creator - helped me get a more clear background on the intention of the framework, and how good and bad OKR's look like. It has some quite useful and relatable examples, and while thee framework itself is not a silver bullet, there are many good parts that can be taken - especially as a tool to reflect on big goals that will push you forward, and how to "divide and conquer" a large objective.
