An exploration of alternative ways of organizing companies - focusing on how to create more adaptive and human organizations in the face of complexity and uncertainty. Dignan argues that the traditional way of working based on hierarchy, bureaucracy and control is outdated and ineffective. Instead, it proposes a new operating system (OS) for work that is based on principles such as autonomy, experimentation, transparency and purpose. It has good practical tools and examples to help with transformation - and specific industry examples (like Gore)
