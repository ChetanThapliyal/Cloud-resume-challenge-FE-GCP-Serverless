The book is dense - but mind-changing. It explores the two main systems of thinking that shape our thought processes â€“ System 1, which is fast and intuitive, and System 2, which is slower and more deliberative. The book argues that our brains are constantly switching between these two systems of thinking, and that understanding how these systems work can help us make better decisions and avoid common cognitive biases. The book is based on Kahneman's research in psychology and behavioral economics, and offers insights into how our minds work and how we can improve our decision-making skills.
