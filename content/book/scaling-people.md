Claire was a leader in early stages of Google, and now is the COO at Stripe, since quite early also. It is a fantastic guide, very practical and full of detailed examples on how to build a massive impact company - and how to scale it. It takes a lot of attention to the people management side and covers a wide variety of topics, from crafting foundational documents to strategic and financial planning, hiring and team development, feedback and performance mechanisms. The book includes dozens of pages of worksheets, templates, exercises, and example documents to help founders, leaders, and company builders create scalable operating systems and lightweight processes that really work.
