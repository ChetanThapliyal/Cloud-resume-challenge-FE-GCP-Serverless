The story of Tom Fadell, the inventor of the iPod and the Nest thermostat, and his journey as an entrepreneur and leader. It's very interesting to see how the drive of Fadell was challenged by corporate situations, and how the drive to innovate and create products was stronger than the slowing down forces.
