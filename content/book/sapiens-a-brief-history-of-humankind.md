The book that convinced me to switch to eating vegetarian ðŸŒ±. The book is tells the story of humankind from the emergence of Homo sapiens in Africa to the present day. The book covers a wide range of topics, including human evolution, the rise of agriculture, the development of empires, the Scientific Revolution, and the impact of globalization. Harari presents a sweeping and thought-provoking history of humankind, exploring the ways in which our species has shaped the world and been shaped by it.
