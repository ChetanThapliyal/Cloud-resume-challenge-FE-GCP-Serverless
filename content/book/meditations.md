 It is a collection of personal writings by the Roman Emperor and philosopher Marcus Aurelius. The writings are in the form of short reflections and meditations on a wide range of topics, including ethics, philosophy, and Stoicism. The book served as a strong influence in my personal view of the world, and my personal philosophy on life.
