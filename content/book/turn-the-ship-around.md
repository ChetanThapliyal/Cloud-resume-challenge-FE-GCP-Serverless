A leadership guide that teaches the importance of empowering team members and fostering a culture of accountability, told from the real story of a navy officer that gets the responsibility of a dysfunctional submarine. It introduced me to the concept of leader-leader, and how empowerment can be used as a force for transformation and collective ownership and accountability.
