Based on Netflix's story - the book gets deeper into the culture of the company, focusing on the freedom and responsibility, with the gains on high performance, innovation and growth. For that, it explains how to set clear expectations and hold people accountable, and how to foster a sense of purpose and meaning in work. It gives very useful context on some concepts that have been popularized by Netlix, such as talent density, the keeper test, or their approach for paying "top of the market". Very well told - and while you can't just copy-paste a company culture, it serves a lot to see the reflection that lead to it.
