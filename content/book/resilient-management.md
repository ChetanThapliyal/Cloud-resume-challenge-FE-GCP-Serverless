It has a very good toolset for first time EM's, or for anyone that wants to review some proven ways of working. It is structured in 5 chapters ("Meet your team", "Grow your teammates", "Set clear expectations", "Communicate Effectively" and "Build resiliency"), and it's full of good tips, with a human-centric approach. Very useful for these turbulent times!
