A guide on how to create new markets, and compete in new areas without competition; instead of fighting for market share growth in crowded markets. I liked how it could result counter-intuitive, but sometimes it's best to avoid competition at all, and find a market that is underserved (blue ocean), instead of starting a fight in a proven, competed one (red ocean).
