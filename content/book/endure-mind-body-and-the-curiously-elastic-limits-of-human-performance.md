It explores the limits of human performance and the factors that influence it. The book covers a many topics, including exercise, nutrition, genetics, psychology, and neuroscience, and it examines the latest research on how the body and mind respond to physical and mental challenges. I like the exploration on ways in which body and mind can be pushed to extremes, and how to optimize human performance.
