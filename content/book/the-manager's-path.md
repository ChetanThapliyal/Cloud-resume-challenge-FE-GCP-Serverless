Camille's path will be very helpful for many getting into the technical management track. She went from Tech Lead to CTO - and describes the challenges as she switched roles. It served me to realize that once you're managing people - that has to be the main priority, and the IC track (ie: fixing problems, developing) comes to a second place, or you end being a very weak and non present manager. I  also liked that she covers multiple company sizes and stages, so it's a quite representative journey.
