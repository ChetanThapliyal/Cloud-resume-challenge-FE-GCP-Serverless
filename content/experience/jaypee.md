### Life in field

[Jaiprakash Associates Limited](https://www.jalindia.com/), commonly known as Jaypee Group, is an Indian conglomerate company headquartered in Noida, Uttar Pradesh, with interests in engineering, construction, power, real estate, hospitality, IT, sports and education (non-profit).

In Jaiprakash Associates I was part of a Project Management team working on a Residential Building Project, with a cross-functional combination of roles from different providers, and the client, working together. The technical team was up to 7 people, but it was only a part of the whole - which included a dedicated QA engineering team, Mantainance engineering team, Senior Engineers, Project Managers, and a client representative.

The solution I worked on for 2 years was a cross-cloud implementation in SFCC, with a tech stack strongly oriented towards the Salesforce ecosystem: Javascript in the backend and frontend, SASS, Mulesoft & Java as middleware, Azure as the cloud infrastructure, and the Atlassian ecosystem (JIRA, Confluence, Bamboo) for the day to to day.

My role as tech lead was to provide solutions that would fit in the technical and functional landscape, ensuring maintainability, quality and the right knowledge distribution in the team. For this, the role included coaching new team members, hands-on (pair) programming, and intensive code review to ensure the highest standards and continuous improvement. It also involved the creation of plannings and estimations, and definitions of roadmaps.

As a side track at Jaypee, I also participated in learning Data Science and Python:
- Web Accessibility Live 2018, organised by SiteImprove in Amsterdam: https://siteimprove.com/nl-nl/events/web-accessibility-live-2018/, with a talk about the technical implementation of the accessibility requirements in a e-commerce project.
- Continuous Delivery Amsterdam, https://www.meetup.com/Continuous-Delivery-Amsterdam/events/247988829/, with a talk about CD/CI in Salesforce Commerce Cloud.

- Played a vital role in project management within the real estate sector, leveraging extensive mechanical engineering expertise to lead and collaborate with cross-functional teams, ensuring successful project execution.
- Expertly utilized problem-solving skills to address intricate technical issues, significantly enhancing project efficiency and performance.
- Produced comprehensive technical documentation encompassing detailed drawings, specifications, and reports, contributing to streamlined project progression and serving as valuable references for future endeavors.
- Spearheaded effective communication with clients and stakeholders, facilitating transparent updates on project milestones and promptly addressing any concerns, fostering strong collaborative relationships within the project ecosystem.
