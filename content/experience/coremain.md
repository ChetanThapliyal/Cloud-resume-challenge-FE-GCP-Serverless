### Contact with enterprise private project

After the stay at Bah√≠a I wanted to check if the knowledge that I was gaining would be applicable in other companies, and I could help also setup new teams in a different environment.

At Coremain I had a fruitful stay, participating in a greenfield project for a consumer bank, participating on the design and implementation of the solution that would create a new internal portal.
