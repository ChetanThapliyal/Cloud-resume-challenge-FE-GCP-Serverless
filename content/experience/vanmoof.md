## Startup-life

VanMoof is a developer and designer of urban e-bikes, with a Direct-to-consumer model.

With retail locations in Tokyo, Berlin, San Francisco, London, Paris, Taipei - I joined in the moment that the company started to shape as a scale-up - joining just before the [Series-A ($13.5M)](https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/12/vanmoof-raises-13-5m-to-capitalize-on-e-bike-boom-in-wake-of-covid-19/) and [B ($40M)](https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/16/after-lockdowns-lead-to-an-e-bike-boom-vanmoof-raises-40m-series-b-to-expand-globally/) investment rounds.

During my work at VanMoof I participated in in-sourcing efforts, to bring technology closer to the core of the company, especially in the digital ecosystem (which included the content and marketing sites, e-commerce systems, ERP, customer support, and other custom-developed solutions both for internal and customer use).

The team grew fast while I worked at VanMoof. In the early stage I worked as Tech Lead, focusing in an Individual Contributor track mixed with technical leadership, and participated in in-sourcing the development of the platform and setting up fundaments like continous integration, pull request review processes, or infrastructure as code and [24x7 service](https://helecloud.com/case-studies/vanmoof-rides-into-the-future-with-aws/). 
As the team scaled up in the hypergrowth phase, I participated in the organization of the teams, shaping my role as an Engineering Manager, and setting new disciplines (such as QA department, frontend-development), new platforms (such as the [definition and launch of the partner network](https://www.vanmoof.com/blog/en/expanding-our-certified-workshops-network), shaping the collaboration with the [development partners Info.nl](https://info.nl/en/conversation/vanmoof-chooses-info-as-digital-partner-for-their-global-service-expansion/)).
