### Transition to IT, started freelance blogging and Technical Writing ‚úçüèº

As a lifelong tech enthusiast, I made an exciting career shift into the dynamic world of IT in December 2022, focusing on the exciting fields of Cloud Engineering and DevOps. My ingrained 'geek' tendencies fueled a passion for Linux and Git version control, which I'd been using for five years in both personal and professional projects. This foundation gave me a head start with DevOps concepts and technologies. Additionally, my prior experience working on AI/ML projects with Python made picking up Golang a breeze.

After transitioning, I began taking on freelance projects with a former colleague, and the opportunities quickly multiplied. With every technical blog, every instructional guide I wrote, I learned something new. But my mechanical past gave me an angle most tech writers didn't have ‚Äì engineers need clear blueprints, and my writing became that. When I explained tech, people actually implemented it correctly, which felt like a win even beyond the words on the page.

But I wanted to do more. I started coding scripts, first in Bash, then in Go. It helped me, sure, but it also created systems for non-technical folks to manage the complex documentation I was producing. This was engineering, just a different kind.

I'm still figuring this new path out, but it fits. I'm not an ex-mechanical engineer turned cloud enthusiast; I'm an engineer who happens to speak the languages of cloud development and the people who build those digital worlds. And damn, that feels powerful.


### Key Achievements:

- Authored numerous well-received technical blogs and documents, resulting in a consistent 20% increase in community engagement and readership.
- Developed comprehensive technical guides and instructional content using Linux and shell scripting.
- Crafted and maintained an extensive library of technical documentation, resulting in improved accessibility for non-technical stakeholders.
- Played a pivotal role in a collaborative project to document Google Cloud Platform best practices, facilitating a broader understanding and adoption among developers.
- Engineered multiple scripts using Bash and Go to automate content workflows, increasing efficiency of content updates by 40%.
